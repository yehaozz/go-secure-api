# go-secure-api

## Project Scope
This project focuses on building a small, cloud-native API service using Go, deployed on Kubernetes, with OAuth2 for authentication. The goal is to practice developing a scalable, secure API in a distributed cloud environment with modern security protocols and infrastructure automation.

### Set Up and Build API Service in Go

1. Set Up Development Environment:
* Install Go, Docker, and kubectl for Kubernetes.
* Choose a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) or use Minikube for local Kubernetes deployment.

2. Develop the API Service in Go:
* Build a simple REST API service in Go (e.g., a basic task manager or a CRUD app for managing user data).
* Implement routing, data handling, and basic error handling.
* TODO: Connect to a cloud database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

3. API Security with OAuth2:
* Integrate OAuth2 for authentication, using a service like Auth0, Okta, or Firebase Authentication to manage OAuth2 tokens.
* Protect specific API endpoints so only authenticated users can access them.

### Containerization and Kubernetes Deployment
